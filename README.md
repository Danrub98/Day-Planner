# Day-Planner

The day planner website was created with the intention that the User is able to set an schedule for the day. The program was made with Bootstrap and JavaScript. The date is updated every second and also the blocks change color depending on what time of the day we are, making the hour we are currently in have a different color.

To use the program, the User needs to write information in the table, once the text is written, the User needs to click in the Save Icon to start an event in the JavaScript code, saving the User input in the local storage, that way, if the User refreshes the page, the information is still visible.
